## Getting Started

Welcome to my personal portfolio! 
Original design credit goes to Britanny Chiang [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4)

### To Run

You need to have npm and Angular CLI installed in your pc. Npm is available with NodeJS [here](https://nodejs.org/es/). After you install npm, install Angular CLI by typing the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Now just clone the repo and download the dependencies using npm:

``` bash
npm install
```

Now you can modify the code to match your projects and see it in your browser by doing:

```
npm start
```

Then go to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)

### Thank you!
