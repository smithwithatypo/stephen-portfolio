  "AboutMe.Paragraphs": [
    "In my <span class='underline'>5 years developing software</span>, I’ve made life easier for teammates at Apple and Dell, while spending my free time coding tools to amplify the efforts of the Center for Child Protection, local artists, and underpriveledged students. I’m currently leading two open source projects building an AI-native teaching assistant being used at Texas State University, and a mobile app being used by Meals On Wheels.",
    "My <span class='underline'>leadership skills</span> have been honed by incredible mentors while leading hundreds of projects at Apple, leading two student clubs with IEEE and Google, and founding/dissolving two startups. My <span class='underline'>software skills</span> can be attributed to years in academic research, 3 internships, and building dozens of personal projects. I'm very comfortable in novel problem spaces.",
